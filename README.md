Octo7, Blacktocats, OctoAsians, Octogatos, and Adacats are pairing up to bring Hubbers a day of learning and brainstorming from within our communities. 

**Epic Planning Brainstorm:** We are using the best practices we have picked up across this stack and our skillsets to do an epic planning session for the next iterations of the Amplify product.

**Learning Circle with CoBs:** For the second part of the learning and brainstorm day, we have 3 panels for you to listen to and deepen your understanding of sustainability, land stewardship, and Indigenous communities across the globe

## Challenge: <a name = "challenge"></a>
Take the [Amplify app](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/hackathon-landing/blob/main/AmplifyApp.md) to the next level so its robust enough to go from supporting **~40 advocacy groups to hundreds** across civic rights and sustanability. 
The first part of an Earth Day Learning Day will focus on your input on the following issues for best implementation practices

# What is ProgramEquity? <a name = "story"></a>
ProgramEquity provides research driven and designed through community dialogue through skillbased volunteer workflows. 5 hours, 40 advocacy groups and Indigenous led land trusts, unified climate action. 
<img width="1311" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-11 at 7 32 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9143339/149059155-5c3e5854-0d71-454d-867b-5e5e06598731.png">


[Indigenous people protect over 80% of the world's diversity](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/can-indigenous-land-stewardship-protect-biodiversity-), this learning day  is an opening conversation for us to start understanding our relationship with our earth and the very ground we stand on today as sentient. 

Our connection with our Earth is fostered through climate action and we're dedicating the day to evolving the [Amplify platform](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/hackathon-landing/blob/main/AmplifyApp.md) to accomodate more than 40+ advocacy groups based in sustainability.

Sustainability happens when we transform the dynamic of land belonging to us to how we can belong to the land we occupy. This work is often led by advocacy groups who just like open source - rely on volunteer contributors.
